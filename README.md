# Gender Bias in Google Translation of Japanese and Vietnamese\
# Inspired by the paper Assessing gender bias in machine translation: a case study with Google Translate by Prates, Avelar and Lamb, this project seeks to verify the paper’s findings three years later with analysis of two gender neutral languages: Japanese and Vietnamese. Since the paper by Prates, Avelar and Lamb was written in 2018, Google Translate has updated its software in an attempt to mitigate gender bias in its translations, therefore this paper also serves as an audit of Google’s adjustments to its translation algorithm.
